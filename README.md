# Firebase Image Uploads

There are a lot of different services that allow you to upload and store images. A lot of them are confusing and take way too long to set up. To think, that's time that you could have been adding more features.


# What is Firebase? 
Firebase is a BaaS(Backend As A Service) ran by Google that allows you to do many things ranging from authentication, to cloud storage, to database functionality. They even give you free hosting, but I digress.
